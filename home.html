            <h2>Origin:</h2>
            <p>Milk tea originated in Hong Kong during British colonial rule, while
              bubble tea originated sometime in the 1980s in Taiwan.
            </p>

            <h2>Popularity:</h2>
            <p>Bubble tea arrived in the bay area around the mid 1990s.  However,
              it did not become popular until around 2014, when more milk tea shops
              began popping up all over the bay area.  Now if you drive around the
              bay area you can find a milk tea shop just about anywhere!
            </p>

            <h2>Why I like it:</h2>
            <p>I first got a taste of milk tea around 2015.  At first it was nothing
              special.  After a few years, more milk tea shops began to pop up offering
              new types of drinks.  I only really started to like milk tea, when salted
              cheese was added as a topping to the drinks.  I also prefer it to coffee
              because coffee irritates my stomach.
